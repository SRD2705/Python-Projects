This project creates a GUI in which you can input any text and it can playing after pressing "PLAY" button.
It is a basic project but it is useful when you want to hear about any thesis or report without reading it.
Just copy the text paste it on the text bar and click on "PLAY"


we need to install Tinkter, gtts, playsound module to make the project work.
Tinkter is a GUI interface for Python 
gtts is Google Text to Speech module

    In this program we first made a GUI for taking an input and run the operation.Then when user provide inpu, we convert it to
    a mp3 file format and save the file.After that we open the file and play it.
